## About Me

I started my programming journey in early 2019, although in an unstructured manner. However, it was in May 2020 when I truly dedicated myself to development and started studying continuously. In December 2021, I began my professional career as a developer, where I contributed to the development of an internal design system for both web and mobile applications. I also participated in the development of a mobile app. Later, in June 2022, I embarked on a training program as an intern at a large company, focusing on software development. Two months after the training, I joined the company as an intern, where I am currently involved in developing, maintaining, debugging, and adding new features to the mobile app for Camicado stores, which is part of the renowned Brazilian group, Grupo Renner.
